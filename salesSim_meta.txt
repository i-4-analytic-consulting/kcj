1. attached is a file typical of a file (but smaller)  that i will to run a regression on.  the format is:

        CustID  9. 
        income  5.
        gender  1. 
        marital 1. '

        offers  1. '
        sales   1. '
        VP        9.6 
    
the regression needs to estimate the model: 
-sales = income gender marital 
-no intercept on observations where offer = 1
-dump the parameter estimates to a flat file i can then read.

the shell i will write in c/c++ will:
-generate test data files
-issue a command line call to r to do the estimation 
-read the parameter results 
-display some graphs

propose this:
-set up R to import this standard file 
-estimates the betas 
-write beta estimates to a file

once that is down we can coordinate my installing R with your help
